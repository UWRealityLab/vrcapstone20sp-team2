						<h3>Blog 2</h3>
							<p>This week we decided to narrow the focus of our project. Our initial idea was to have this grand laboratory environment that simulates real life. It would include proper chemistry sets, as well as train the user to practice proper laboratory safety. However, given our 7 week timeframe, we realized that this was not going possible.  So, we decided to center our project around the actual process of developing a vaccine. While this in itself is also a difficult process to match, we will simplify it to fit into our project. Specifically, the game will be divided into different sections that make up the vaccine development process. We will implement the first section as part of our MVP. It will involve pipetting the virus into a petri dish of chicken cells, blending it with a centrifuge, and heating chemicals with a bunsen burner.</p>
							<p>Plan for next week:
								<br>Load up a laboratory scene in Unity and implement pipetting. The virus and chicken cells will start in a refrigerator and must be grabbed out of the fridge. Afterwards, the player must pipette a sample of the virus into the chicken cells, and let the virus sit for a bit. We will install several Unity assets that include the necessary laboratory equipment, as well as a lab itself. Frank and Steve will work on getting the lab loaded into Unity, and making the prefabs interactable.  Dylan and Tianyang will work on implementing the pipetting mechanism.
								<br>
						<h3>Blog 1</h3>
						<p>Week 1: For the first week, we got together as a class to work through the unity tutorials and oculus tutorials which introduced the basic techniques we will be using in Unity. After the class, we share our brainstormed project ideas together and evaluated each of them to decide which one we are going to work with.<p>

						<p>Week 2: During the second week, we finalized our project proposal by discussing the potentials with the instructors and TAs. We listened to the creative ideas and comment about how to make our project more meaningful to the community. After we planned out the overall blueprint for our project, each of us took one task to finish this week. Dylan worked on setting up the template and website for our project. Steve recorded the pitch video, Tianyi wrote the project proposal and Yongzhe finished the blog 1.<p>

						<p>Plan for next week:
						<br>We will set the initial lab environment for the project and allocating basic lab instruments and hazmat suits to the scene. The first milestone we are going to accomplish is the contamination process both before entering and exiting the laboratory. It requires the following steps:
						<br>
						<ul>
							<li> Change the Laboratory suit properly before entering.</li>
							<li> Shower upon exiting.</li>
							<li> Decontaminate all materials before exiting.</li>
						</ul>
